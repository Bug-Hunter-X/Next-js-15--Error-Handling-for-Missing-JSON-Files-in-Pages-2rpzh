# Next.js 15: Error Handling for Missing JSON Files in Pages

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error that can occur in Next.js 15 applications when attempting to import and use JSON files within page components. The problem arises when the specified JSON file is not found in the expected location, leading to runtime errors.

## The Bug
The `pages/about.js` attempts to import and use a `data.json` file. If `data.json` is missing, Next.js throws an error.  This error is not always easy to identify.

## The Solution
The solution involves adding robust error handling to gracefully manage situations where the JSON file might be missing. This can be achieved using try-catch blocks or conditional checks.
